# Mooku_lipi üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: TechLet


### Team Members
- Team Lead: shaheem
- Member 2: sajin


### Project Description
A ridiculous-yet-genius system that transforms your nose into a magical stylus for writing Malayalam letters in thin air. Powered by questionable AI judgments and celebratory fireworks.

### The Problem (That We Invented)
Because clearly:
- Traditional pen-and-paper writing is *so* 20th century
- Normal people struggle with remembering if ‡¥ó has one loop or two
- The world desperately needed nose-based calligraphy

### The Solution (That Defies Logic)
We created a system where:
1. Your schnoz becomes the ultimate writing tool üèÜüëÉ
2. AI ruthlessly grades your nasal penmanship
3. You earn virtual fireworks for not looking completely foolish


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
**Software Alchemy:**
- `Python 3.8+` (because we like f-strings)
- `MediaPipe` (to stalk your facial movements)
- `Gemini AI` (to deliver savage accuracy ratings)
- `OpenCV` (to witness your struggles in real-time)
- `Pygame` (for the "Yay!" sounds when you don't fail)

**Hardware Requirements:**
- 1 x Webcam (720p or better - nose hairs should be visible)
- 1 x Functioning human face (nose mandatory)
- Optional: Kerala-style snacks for authentic learning experience

### Implementation
```bash
# Installation (warning: may install dad jokes)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Execution (prepare for humiliation)
python mooku_lipi.py
```
